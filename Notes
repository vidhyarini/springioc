Spring Framework:
-It can create objects for you and manage the objects see 01.png using config file
-All the objects created in a IOC Container and manages it are called the Spring Bean
-To use the objects in the IOC Container,  we need to use getBean("a"); see 02

IOC Container:
Two types
    -Bean Factory - is an Interface  - Is not used much now
    -Application Context - is also an Interface - It has more advanced features

    So to use Application Context we need a class to call the interface
    -We have a class named ClassPathXMLApplicationContext
Create bean.xml file under scr
    - give the <?xml> line
    -name the spring bean with the id reference
